Hello, this is my first attempt at creating a landing page from scratch.

The layout for this page was based from The Odin Project's Landing Page project. It is a cumulative project that tries to apply various lessons previously taught including HTML and CSS basics.

To successfully layout and accomplish this project, I mainly used Flexbox and Media query to make it as responsive as possible.
